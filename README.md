# configurator-ui (at this point, just for i3 colors)

A page that allows you to visualize what a certain i3 window color config results in.

## Running

`npm i && npm start`, then go to `localhost:3000` 

## Todo

Everything.

_P.S. this was done with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), and was inspired by [this](https://thomashunter.name/i3-configurator/)_
